### SYSTEM MONITOR ###
This is a private project to monitor my computer, using some of the gems I already created, and it will be updated, as I feel my other projects satisfy its needs more completely. Note that this is not an actual package/gem in itself, but you can feel free to clone it, when you think it does what you need, or even just for some inspiration for doing similar.

It is going to use the Supervisor/Server model I am familiar with from Elixir.

### TO DO ###
1) Make the servers
1) Create a collection of supervisors to manage the servers
1) Add additional servers for my specific use cases
1) Probably a whole bunch of other stuff, but this project is a long time coming, and it's going to replace some hacked-together garbage I was previously using.

### INSTALLATION ###
